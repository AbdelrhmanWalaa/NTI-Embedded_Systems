Welcome to the Embedded Systems Programming Guide! This README.md file provides an overview of the key topics covered in this repository, aimed at empowering you with essential knowledge in the realm of ARM architecture and general-purpose embedded systems programming.

## Overview

The course covers the following key modules and highlights:

1. **ARM Architecture:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of the ARM architecture, a popular and widely used processor architecture in the embedded systems industry.

2. **General Purpose Input Output Programming (GPIO):** Learn how to program GPIO pins to interact with external devices and peripherals, enabling input and output operations.

3. **Timer Concepts (Time and Signal Generation):** Explore timer modules and their applications in generating accurate time delays and signal waveforms.

4. **Interrupts and Interrupt Types:** Understand the importance of interrupts in embedded systems and how to handle both internal and external interrupt sources.

5. **Interfacing of LCD Display:** Learn how to interface and control an LCD display to display information and interact with users.

6. **PWM Register in Timer & PWM Drivers:** Master Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques, which are vital for controlling motor speed, LED brightness, and other analog-like behaviors in digital systems.

7. **Analog Interfacing with Analog to Digital Converter (ADC):** Discover how to interface analog sensors and devices with the ADC module to convert analog signals to digital values.

8. **Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receive Transmit (UART Protocol):** Dive into UART communication, a widely used serial communication protocol for transmitting and receiving data.

9. **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI Protocol):** Explore the SPI protocol, commonly used to interface with peripherals and exchange data in a synchronous manner.

10. **Inter-Integrated Circuit or Two-Wire Interface (I2C or TWI Protocol):** Understand the I2C/TWI protocol, ideal for communication with multiple devices using just two wires.
