# Overview

Welcome to our comprehensive training program, comprising four modules that cover essential aspects of embedded systems development. In this README.md file, we will provide an overview of each module and the key concepts you will learn throughout the course.

### Module 1 - "C and Embedded C Programming":

In this module, we will dive into the world of C programming in the context of embedded systems. You will not only gain a solid foundation in the C programming language but also learn how to program modern embedded microcontrollers using real-time development tools. This course serves as an excellent primer for those interested in embedded programming and hardware-software integration.

### Module 2 - "Microcontroller Architecture and Interfacing with AVR":

This module focuses on microcontroller programming for the AVR-MCU using an AV-Kit. You will delve into the architecture of AVR microcontrollers and learn how to interface them with external components. By the end of this module, you will have hands-on experience in developing applications for AVR-based embedded systems.

### Module 3 - "Microcontroller Architecture and Interfacing with ARM Cortex":

In Module 3, we shift our attention to advanced ARM Cortex microcontrollers, specifically using the STM32 MCU. You will learn the intricacies of programming ARM Cortex microcontrollers and explore the vast capabilities they offer. By the end of this module, you will be proficient in developing applications for ARM-based embedded systems.

### Module 4 - "RTOS and Automotive":

The final module is dedicated to Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and automotive embedded systems. You will gain a deep understanding of RTOS concepts, design, and implementation. Additionally, we will cover essential theoretical and practical techniques to effectively work with RTOS. Moreover, you will explore the exciting world of automotive embedded systems, learning about automotive protocols such as LIN and CAN, and understanding AUTOSAR architecture. By the end of this module, you will be equipped to develop automotive applications, utilize embedded systems technologies, and work on applied automotive projects.
