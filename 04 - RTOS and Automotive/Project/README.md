## Overview

The Smart Home System is an innovative application that enables real-time control of home temperature and lighting. The system also provides enhanced security features by allowing users to access doors using a password. 

In case of an incorrect password, the system triggers a door alarm and sends a notification to the user's mobile (UART) device. With this comprehensive solution, users can enjoy increased convenience, comfort, and safety in their homes.

## Features

- **Real-time Home Temperature Control:** The Smart Home System allows users to monitor and adjust the home temperature in real-time. By leveraging smart technology, users can optimize energy consumption and create a comfortable living environment.

- **Home Lighting System Control:** Users can conveniently control the home lighting system through the application. This feature offers remote access to switch lights on or off, enhancing energy efficiency and providing added security.

- **Secure Door Access with Password:** The application provides a secure means of accessing doors through password authentication. Users can set and manage passwords to restrict unauthorized access to their homes.

- **Door Alarm for Incorrect Password Attempts:** In the event of multiple incorrect password attempts, the system triggers a door alarm, notifying the occupants and deterring potential intruders.

- **Mobile Notifications (UART):** The Smart Home System ensures that users stay informed even when away from home. When the door alarm is activated, the system sends a notification to the user's mobile device, enabling quick response and peace of mind.
