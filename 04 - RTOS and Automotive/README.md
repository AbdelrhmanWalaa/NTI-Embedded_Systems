Welcome to the Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and Automotive Embedded Systems course! This comprehensive course is designed to provide you with a solid understanding of RTOS concepts, real-time systems, and their practical application in the automotive industry. Throughout this course, you will delve into the fundamentals of RTOS, explore various synchronization mechanisms, and gain expertise in designing automotive embedded systems.

## Overview

The course covers the following key modules and highlights:

1. **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):** You will begin by getting introduced to Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), understanding their significance in time-critical applications, and exploring the key components such as tasks and TCBs (Task Control Blocks).

2. **Real-Time Systems (RTS):** In addition to RTOS, you will grasp the fundamental concepts of Real-Time Systems (RTS) and the principles behind achieving time determinism and predictability in embedded systems.

3. **RTOS Scheduler Types:** You will dive into the different types of RTOS schedulers, understanding their advantages and selecting the appropriate one for various application scenarios.

4. **Reentrant and Non-Reentrant Functions:** Gain insights into reentrant and non-reentrant functions, comprehend their usage in multi-threaded environments, and ensure thread safety in your projects.

5. **Priority Inheritance and Priority Inversion:** Explore the crucial topics of priority inheritance and priority inversion, vital for maintaining system stability and performance in real-time systems.

6. **Synchronization Mechanisms:** Understand various synchronization mechanisms, such as binary semaphores, mutual exclusion semaphores, counting semaphores, and event groups, to enable smooth communication and coordination between tasks.

7. **Automotive Embedded Systems:** In the second part of the course, you will shift your focus to automotive embedded systems and dive into the technologies behind them.

8. **Automotive Protocols:** Explore popular automotive protocols, including LIN (Local Interconnect Network) and CAN (Controller Area Network), and understand their applications in the automotive industry.

9. **AUTOSAR Architecture:** Develop a comprehensive understanding of AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) architecture, a standard for automotive software development.

10. **Building Automotive Embedded Systems:** Utilize your newfound knowledge to design, develop, and distribute stand-alone automotive applications of varying complexity, honing your programming skills for automotive microcontrollers.
