## Overview

The Temperature Control System is an intelligent solution designed to control appliances based on the temperature levels in a given environment. The system stores temperature defaults in memory and takes actions accordingly, ensuring optimal comfort and energy efficiency. Users have the flexibility to adjust these defaults at the beginning of the system, tailoring the settings to their specific needs.

## Features

- **Temperature-based Appliance Control:** The system monitors the temperature in the environment and controls connected appliances, such as heaters, air conditioners, or fans, to maintain a desired temperature range.

- **Temperature Defaults Storage:** Users can set and store temperature defaults in memory, allowing the system to operate based on the pre-defined settings.

- **Customizable Settings:** At the start of the system, users have the freedom to adjust the temperature defaults according to their preferences and requirements.

- **Energy Efficiency:** By intelligently controlling appliances based on temperature levels, the system promotes energy efficiency, reducing unnecessary energy consumption and contributing to cost savings.

- **User-friendly Interface:** The system provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact with the temperature control settings.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Users can view real-time temperature data and system status, enabling them to stay informed about the environment's conditions and the system's operation.

- **Automated Actions:** The Temperature Control System can automatically take actions, such as turning on or off appliances, based on the temperature thresholds defined by the user.

- **Alerts and Notifications:** The system can send alerts or notifications to users when the temperature exceeds specified limits or when the system requires attention.
